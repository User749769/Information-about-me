# I am just a normal high school student.
# I am new to programming so I don't really know that much about it.
# I created a GitHub account so that I can keep my projects organized. (Truth be told, I barely know how GitHub works)
# That's it to be honest. Hope you have a fantastic rest of the day/night.
